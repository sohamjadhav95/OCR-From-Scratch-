# âœ… Phase 1: Data Preparation (For OCR with Neural Networks)

## Step: Convert Images to Preprocessed Tensors (.pt)

## âœ… What We Already Have
- Dataset with ~400,000 character images
- Organized into class folders (e.g., A, B, C or Sample001, Sample002, ...)
- Images are in JPG/PNG format and vary in size and color

## ðŸŽ¯ What We're Doing in This Step
- Convert all images to **grayscale**
- Resize to fixed dimension (**32Ã—32**)
- Normalize pixel values (0â€“255 â†’ 0.0â€“1.0)
- Convert to **PyTorch tensors** with shape [1, 32, 32]
- Save each image as a `.pt` file
- Save a CSV mapping: `filename â†’ label`

## ðŸ“‚ Output Folder Structure

## ðŸ“¥ Dataset

The training dataset (32Ã—32 grayscale OCR images) can be downloaded from:

ðŸ”— [Download Dataset from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-r-htbRTrfOyIRhMFSkzz6S2XYYEgItq/view?usp=drive_link)

**Note**: After download, extract into `Data/ResizedDataset` before running training scripts.



# ðŸ“¦ Phase 2: Dataset & DataLoader Setup (OCR Project)

## âœ… Objective
Prepare a PyTorch-compatible dataset loader that:
- Reads 400K+ grayscale images (32Ã—32)
- Labels each image based on its folder
- Loads data in mini-batches
- Converts images to tensors for model training

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure

Each character class is stored in its own folder:

ProcessedDataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ Sample001/ â†’ Label 0 (Digit 0)
â”œâ”€â”€ Sample002/ â†’ Label 1 (Digit 1)
...
â”œâ”€â”€ Sample011/ â†’ Label 10 (A)
...
â”œâ”€â”€ Sample062/ â†’ Label 61 (z)


Total Classes: **62**  
(10 digits + 26 uppercase + 26 lowercase)

## ðŸ§  What We Did

1. **Created `OCRDataset` class** in `OCR_dataset.py`
2. Defined image transform:
   - Convert to grayscale (if needed)
   - Resize to 32Ã—32 (safety step)
   - Normalize to [0, 1] float tensor
3. Extracted labels using folder index
4. Made compatible with `DataLoader`

### ðŸš€ Phase 3: Training Loop (`train.py`)

- Loads 32Ã—32 grayscale images using custom `OCRDataset`
- Uses `OCRNet` CNN model for classification (62 output classes)
- Trains the model using `CrossEntropyLoss` and `Adam` optimizer
- Tracks training progress in real-time using 1â€“100% scale
- Saves final model weights to `ocr_model.pth`
